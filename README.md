# Resume-Analyzer
Developed an interactive web application that analyzes PDF resumes and matches them with job descriptions using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The system evaluates the textual similarity between resumes and job postings through TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity, returning a match score as a percentage.
